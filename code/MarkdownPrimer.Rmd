# First Section

We just created our first section in this document. Spacing is very important in markdown, so we left a blank line after the hash tag.

We create a new paragraph by leaving a blank line. See how important spaces are in markdown?

# Second Section

To create a new section, simply start a new section. No need to clost the previous section. Again, leave spaces.

# Let's Talk About Subsections

To create a subection, use two hashtags.

## First Subsection

We now have a subsection in the enclosing section.

## Second Section

To start a new subsection, simply start a new one, no closing the old one, just like wtih sections.

# Back to Sections

Return to sections just by starting a new section. Very simple.
